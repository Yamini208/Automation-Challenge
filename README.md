# Automation-Challenge

In this Automation Challenge I have developed and tested a selenium based automation script to verify the functionalities outlined in the provided test cases.

Tools and Technologies  I have used in this Automation Challenge: 
1. Python: The primary language for writing the Selenium script.
2. Selenium WebDriver: For automating web interactions.
3. ChromeDriver: To drive the browser.
4. VS Code: Integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and running the scripts.
